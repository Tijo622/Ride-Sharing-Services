Dynamic Pricing Optimization for Ride-Sharing Services

Developed a predictive model that dynamically suggests optimal ride prices for a ride-sharing service, balancing user affordability with company profitability. 
The Dynamic Pricing Model App is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The app uses a DecisionTree Regressor model trained on historical ride data to predict ride prices based on user input.
Features
Predict ride prices based on user inputs such as number of riders, number of drivers, vehicle type, and expected ride duration.
Visualize the predicted ride prices against actual values using Plotly graphs.
Provide insights into the distribution of profitable and loss rides.
Handle missing data through preprocessing techniques.
Incorporate a DecisionTree Regressor model to predict prices.
